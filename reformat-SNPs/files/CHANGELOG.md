# FTDNA SNP.csv changes

File `SNP_Results_344010_07-24-2025.csv` aka "SNP Results" is downloaded from FTDNA [My Y-DNA Haplotree](https://www.familytreedna.com/my/y-dna-haplotree) page.

And it is expected, that some new SNPs to appear at least once per year.

- `A2673,Negative,Big Y-700` - belongs to A0-T level
- `FGC27714,Positive,Big Y-700` - belongs to A0-T level

Note that since June 2025 there was split under `FT89045`, and new SNP `BY181496` and alternatives are presumably negative for me, and as of 24-Jul-2025 they are NOT even listed as Negative. Details in [my article](https://lundiak.wordpress.com/2025/06/08/y-dna-i2a-fgc63213-ft89045/).
